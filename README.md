# SPDF Website Data Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites as part of my learning in ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in the 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While navigating through the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) website, I discovered that some potentially sensitive data related to NASA's space physics missions, contact information, and FTP access details are publicly accessible. This data is located on the following links:

- **Public Data Directory (SPDF):**  
  `https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/`
  
- **Public Data Directory (CDAWeb):**  
  `https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/`
  
- **FTP Access for Data:**  
  `ftp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub`  
  `ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub`

In addition, the contact details of NASA officials and sensitive internal structure details are available publicly. This could lead to unauthorized access if not properly secured.

> **Note**: The links are functional and accessible.

## Steps
1. Visit the URLs mentioned above to verify the exposed data.
2. You may find sensitive contact details, FTP access URLs, and directory structures that could provide more information about the archived data and internal NASA services.

## Recommendation
Please review this report and ensure that sensitive data related to NASA's space physics data and internal operations is properly secured. I recommend implementing stronger access controls for directories and files, and ensuring that sensitive contact details and access points are not publicly accessible.
